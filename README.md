## Running the application in dev mode

```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./gradlew build
```
It produces the `simple-server-gradle-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/build` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/lib` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/simple-server-gradle-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/simple-server-gradle-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
